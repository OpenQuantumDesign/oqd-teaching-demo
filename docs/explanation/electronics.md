# Electronics
Once you have all components in the materials list, it is time to start assembling the electronics!
We recommend attaching the Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and driver to the 3D printed electronics plate. 
This will make it easier to put all the electronics inside the 3D printed enclosure, keeping things
tidy; however, this is not necessary, especially if students will be using & learning the hardware.

## Set up the Raspberry Pi

## Build and wire the acoustic trap

## Wire the lasers
